Xinlei is a postgraduate research assistant at the HaVRI Lab, directed by Dr. Heather Culbertson at the University of Southern California. He recently graduated with an MS in Computer Engineering from the same institution. His research interests include human-computer interaction, haptics, and robotics. Currently, he is working on prototyping novel haptic devices and using reinforcement learning methods to discover human perception. Before this, he worked in the Valero Lab, advised by Dr. Francisco Valero-Cuevas, where he developed a computer vision-based Infant Motor Learning Assistant Toy to study whether babies can learn to control their bodies while on their tummies. Previously, Xinlei graduated from Iowa State University with a B.S. in Computer Engineering in December 2021.
